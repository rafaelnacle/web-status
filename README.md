# Web Status Checker 1.0
CLI program to check if a website is online or offline. It can check multiple websites passed by the user input.

This was day 4 challenge of Python Marathon by Bruno Fraga.

In this project I learned a lot about how to make a proper request from any website and return if its online or not.
I learned how try-except on python works also how to make a proper logical flow.

I've used the [Request package](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/user/quickstart/) to make the get requests.
